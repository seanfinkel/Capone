4. Data -> Load all from Web
5. Click Cancel before the progress bar finishes loading

NOTE:
- There are several try/catch blocks that will never be covered by the above testing. This is due to the semantics of Java.
- When closing the window, the code in CaponeUI (lines 147-149) that writes the UserProfile to disk appears to not get executed when running Eclemma. However, manual testing has shown that it indeed does work and is covered.
