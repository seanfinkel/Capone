The original intent of this program was to help employers find temporary help in cases where there are absolute and acute labour shortages. Some issues of concern have been raised with the program recently, and as my colleagues and the minister have said, HRSDC is looking into these matters. As a government, we committed in the budget to fixing the program to ensure that Canadians have the first crack at available jobs.</p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">Let me say a few words about our economic outlook and how we are responding to it in our economic action plan 2013.</p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">In March economists met with the <a data-HoCid=\"78777\" href=\"/politicians/jim-flaherty/\" title=\"Jim Flaherty\">Minister of Finance</a> to discuss the economic outlook as well as the risks associated with it. </p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">One of the variables in business planning is the supply of talent available to meet the demand for skilled labour, and there are currently gaps in that supply in various regions of the country. This is why economic action plan 2013 made strong investments in the skills of Canadians. Since the depth of the recession, Canada has seen over 900,000 net new jobs created. These are predominantly full-time, high-paying private sector jobs. We are acting now to equip Canadians with the skills and training they need to obtain high-quality, well-paying jobs. Unfortunately, the opposition voted against these measures to help Canadians.</p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">The Canada jobs grant will provide up to $15,000 or more per person to provide training to connect Canadians with a job that is going unfilled. </p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">We are creating opportunities for apprentices by making it easier to get the experience needed to make the leap to journeyperson status, and we are providing support to under-represented groups, including persons with disabilities, youth, aboriginal people and newcomers, to help them find good jobs in the labour force.</p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">While there are still too many Canadians looking for work, there are regions of this country where employers are unable to find the skills or labour they require to keep their businesses growing. If there is an acute labour shortage, the temporary foreign worker program can assist employers in meeting temporary demands for labour. The reason behind this program is to address the shortages confronted by many regions across Canada. </p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">The Canadian Federation of Independent Business stated in its Business Barometer report that 34% of small and medium-sized companies identified skills shortages as a constraint on growth.</p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">CIBC World Markets reported in December 2012 that 30% of businesses in this country are facing a skilled labour shortage.</p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">It is our responsibility to ensure that employers put Canadians first in line for those job opportunities. Foreign workers can be hired when and only when Canadians or permanent residents are not available or qualified to do the job, but that does not mean the program will help companies make more money by hiring foreign workers at lower wages. This would not be in line with the core principles of the program or with the way it operates.</p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">What are these principles? Canadians must have first priority for job vacancies. While in Canada, temporary foreign workers have the same rights and protections as Canadian workers under the applicable federal or provincial employment standards and labour laws. Foreign workers have to be paid at the same wage as a Canadian worker for the same job in the same location. Let me repeat that, as there appears to be a misunderstanding on this point: employers must prove they pay a temporary foreign worker the same wage they pay a Canadian working for them in that region of the country. They cannot pay less than what they are paying their Canadian employees.</p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">How does the temporary foreign worker program operate? The program is jointly managed by Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, or HRSDC, and Citizenship and Immigration Canada, or CIC. </p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">The first step for an employer who wants to use the program is to send an application form to HRSDC requesting permission to hire temporary foreign workers. HRSDC will then issue a labour market opinion to the employer to inform them of the likely impact these foreign workers would have on the Canadian job market. If the labour opinion is favourable and the application is accepted, then CIC will issue a temporary work permit to a foreign worker.</p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">As for the provinces and territories, they are responsible for overseeing working conditions for all workers, including temporary foreign workers. </p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">The temporary foreign worker program answers a real need. The program is driven by the demands of the labour market and the demographics of our changing workforce. As part of their responsibilities, employers are required to advertise and to recruit Canadians whenever and wherever possible.</p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">Finally, we implemented a new wage structure that guarantees that foreign workers and Canadians performing the same job in the same location will be paid identical wages. Using temporary foreign workers to replace already employed Canadian workers is, as has been stated, totally unacceptable. This is not what the program was designed to do, and it will not be tolerated by this government.</p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">Economic action plan 2013 is committed to reform Canada's temporary foreign worker program. We will ensure that there is no confusion about the rules. In the coming months, we will work with employers to ensure that temporary foreign workers are relied upon only when Canadians cannot fill those jobs. We will ensure that employers make intensive recruitment efforts to hire Canadians before they apply for temporary foreign workers. We will require employers to present a plan to transition to an all-Canadian workforce over time and we will propose the introduction of a user fee for employers applying to use temporary foreign workers through the labour market opinion process.</p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">However, it is our government's goal to ensure employers can find qualified workers here in Canada and fill these jobs. This is why the investments in training were key to budget 2013. Unfortunately, the opposition voted against these investments in Canadian skills. While I can appreciate the concerns of the members across the way, as the government shares many of those same concerns, I cannot support this motion.</p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">The human resources committee has studied the labour market and travelled to all parts of the nation. I was part of and I am a member of the HRSDC committee on human resources. We did travel across the country, as my colleague said in his speech earlier. We did talk to employers. We did talk to people involved in various industries across this country, including small business operators, medium-size and large business operators, and they all, to a person, said the biggest problem they will be facing now and in the future, depending on the part of the country they were in, will be to fill the jobs that would be available in their businesses for both unskilled and skilled labour.</p>\n<p data-HoCid=\"0\" data-originallang=\"en\">The work has been done, as has been mentioned, and therefore we proposed the reforms in our budget. Our government is proposing concrete actions to improve this program to ensure Canadians come first. The time to act is now; therefore, I urge all members to vote against the motion and instead to support our proposed changes to the program.</p>"}, "h2": {"fr": "", "en": "Business of Supply"}, "document_url": "/debates/2013/4/16/", "time": "2013-04-16 15:40:00", "source_id": "7960816", "politician_membership_url": "/politicians/memberships/1121/", "procedural": false}
